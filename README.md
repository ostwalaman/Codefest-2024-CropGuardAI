# CropGuardAI ðŸŒ¾ ðŸ¤–

## Problem Statement
Farmers traditionally rely on historical data and broad weather forecasts, which often fail to provide precise, localized insights needed for effective crop health management. This lack of specific data can lead to inadequate mitigation strategies and significant financial risks due to crop spoilage from unforeseen weather events. There is an urgent need for a proactive approach that equips farmers with real-time, actionable insights tailored to their individual locations, enabling them to minimize losses, optimize harvests, and enhance the sustainability of their farming practices. CropGuardAI proposes to address this challenge by integrating advanced technologies such as AI and data analytics to transform farming into a data-driven field, empowering farmers to make informed decisions and revolutionize risk management in agriculture.
